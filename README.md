A label tag that contains the words "First Name", followed by an input tag inside of it for
the users first name
A label tag that contains the words "Last Name", followed by an input tag inside of it for
the users last name
A label tag that contains the words "Latitude", followed by an input tag inside of it for the
users latitude name
A label tag that contains the words "Longitude", followed by an input tag inside of it for
the users longitude name
A button that says "Get current position"
A button that says "Submit info"
A div with an id of error
A div with an id of success
Add css to set the color of the error div text to be red.
Add css to set the color of the success div text to be green
For each of input tags, add a placeholder attribute that contains the same text as the label tag
contains.
Using the ::placeholder pseudo element, style the placeholder of your input boxes to display
as white text when the browser is more than 700px wide, and black text when it's 700px wide
or smaller. This will give the illusion that the placeholder text is not there on desktop devices.
Add css for the input tags so that they span the full width of the page when the browser is
700px wide or less.
Add css such that the labels text is only visible when the browser is more than 700px wide
(Hint: there are multiple ways that give the illusion that the font is not there anymore, such as
changing the font color or size). The inputs inside of the labels should still be visible at all
screen resolutions.
